### üß† Data Model

The model uses a **single fact table** (`Orders`) with calculated columns and measures for analysis.

**Key Measures (DAX):**

* **Total Sales** = SUM(Orders[Sales])
* **Total Profit** = SUM(Orders[Profit])
* **Profit Margin** = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales])
* **Total Quantity Sold** = SUM(Orders[Quantity])
* **Average Discount** = AVERAGE(Orders[Discount])
